        // Difference between var and let
//         1. Scope
//       var:
//             Function-scoped: It is accessible throughout the function in which it is declared, regardless of block boundaries.
//             Not block-scoped: A var declared inside a block (e.g., inside an if or for block) is accessible outside that block.
//       let:
//             Block-scoped: It is only accessible within the block (enclosed by {}) where it is declared.
//             This provides better control and avoids unintended access.
        var a = 10;
        let b = 20;

        console.log(a);
        console.log(b);

        if (true) {
            var x = 10;
            let y = 20;
        }
        console.log(x); // 10 (var is accessible outside the block)
        console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined (let is block-scoped)


//          2. Re-declaration
//        var:
//              Can be re-declared in the same scope.
//        let:
//              Cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

        var x = 10;
        var x = 100;   // var variable can be redeclared in the same space
        let y = 20;
        let y = 200;   // let varibale can be redeclared in the same space 


        // Due to its function-scoping and potential for bugs, modern JavaScript favors let over var.
